This reposistory includes one folder, "Scripts".

In "Scripts" you will find one python script, "Algorithm Comparison.py". "Algorithm Comparison.py" is a script designed to compare DBSCAN, k-Means, and Hierarchical Clustering to at least two different datasets. The script includes code to load in the datasets, make_moons, make_blobs, and make_circles.


Initially, this project was supposed to have the Python scripts as a jupyter notebook, however due to technical issues, PyCharm was used to run all code and they are saved as .py files.

AI DISCLAIMER: AI was utilized for debugging code to ensure all scripts run accordingly.
